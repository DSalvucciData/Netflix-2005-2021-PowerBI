This repository contains the Power BI dashboard I developed as my final project for the DatData course, demonstrating my skills in data analysis and visualization.

The dashboard explores a Netflix titles dataset (2005-2021), covering information about movies and TV shows, countries of origin, ratings, and release years, It provides clear insights into trends, content distribution, and patterns within the platformâ€™s library over time.
